<h1><center> Game </center></h1>
<h3> <center> <ul> <li>The game is a 100 player battle royale, where you start in a bus, with 99 other players, and you have to drop out, get weapons and shields, and try to survive. </li>
<li>If you die, you are out and have to join another game. As the game goes on, players are forced to go to the safe zone, a storm will come and hurt you if you are in it. </li>
<li>The game is fun because you can build. Instead of hiding behind walls and trees, you can build your own structures, and defend yourself. However, almost everything in the game is destructible, so you are never safe. </li>
<li>The game is great because you can play alone, with a partner, or with 3 friends to try to make it to the end.</li></ul></h3>
